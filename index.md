## Welcome to London Clojurians Code Dojo

At a code dojo event everyone can suggest challenges or little projects to work on.  This site contains a collection of challenges for coding dojo events.  Each challenge should have a description of the problem and any relevant skills or experiences are required to solve the challenge.  Challenges can include hints and tips or even possible solutions (encoraging people to create alternative solutions)

### Challenges websites
There are also external websites that contain challenges suitable for a code dojo event:

- [4Clojure](http://4clojure.com) - small challenges that teach you about Clojure functions
- [Clojure(script) Koans](http://clojurescriptkoans.com/) - a Clojurescript website with small Clojure challenges
- [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) - compete/collaborate to improve your code skills
